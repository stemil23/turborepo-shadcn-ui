# Choosing the Right Strategy for Managing a Design System: Git Submodules, Subtrees, Monorepos, and Package Management

A robust design system is essential for ensuring consistency and efficiency across multiple applications. However, managing a design system that serves various projects while being maintained separately from application development teams can be challenging. The choice of strategy for this setup can significantly impact team productivity, collaboration, and the overall quality of the design system. This article explores various approaches—Git submodules, Git subtree, monorepos, and package management—to help you determine the best fit for your organization.

## Why Design Systems Matter

Design systems provide a unified set of guidelines, components, and best practices that streamline the design and development processes. They ensure consistency across user interfaces, reduce duplication of effort, and improve collaboration between design and development teams. Choosing the right management strategy for your design system is crucial to maximizing these benefits.

## 1. Git Submodules

### Overview

Git submodules allow developers to include and manage a repository inside another Git repository. This method is particularly useful for sharing code—such as a design system—across multiple projects while keeping it versioned separately.

### Pros

- Independent Versioning: Each submodule can maintain its own versioning, making it easy to adopt specific versions of the design system in applications.
- Encapsulation: The design system resides in its repository, enabling independent development, testing, and maintenance.
- Selective Integration: Teams can choose which components of the design system to integrate, promoting modular usage.

### Cons

- Management Overhead: Managing submodules involves additional commands for cloning, updating, and maintaining, which can complicate workflows.
- Risk of Inconsistency: Developers must be diligent about updating submodules across projects to prevent outdated components from being used.

### Best Use Case

Git submodules are ideal for a design system that is stable and does not change frequently, allowing teams to lock down specific versions and reduce the risk of introducing breaking changes into dependent projects.

### Example

A large organization might use submodules for their design system, allowing each application to lock to a specific version while maintaining the flexibility to update when necessary.

## 2. Git Subtree

### Overview

Git subtree allows you to integrate a repository (the design system) into a parent repository (the application) as a subdirectory. This method can simplify management and reduce the complexity often associated with submodules.

### Pros

- Simplified Management: Subtrees do not require separate commands for updating and cloning, making it easier for developers to work with the design system.
- Integrated History: The history of the design system is kept alongside the application, providing better context and tracking of changes.
- Less Friction: Developers interact with the design system files as if they are part of the main project, reducing the barriers to making updates.

### Cons

- Lack of Independent Versioning: Unlike submodules, subtrees do not provide independent versioning, making updates and rollbacks more challenging.
- Potential for Code Bloat: Including the design system directly in the application repository can lead to larger repository sizes and duplication of code across projects.

### Best Use Case

Git subtree is suitable for teams that prefer a simpler workflow without the complexity of managing separate repositories and are willing to integrate the design system directly within their applications.

### Example

A startup with a fast-paced development cycle might choose Git subtree to ensure that their design system updates are immediately available in their applications, allowing for rapid iteration.

## 3. Monorepo with a Build Tool (e.g., Turborepo)

### Overview

A monorepo strategy involves placing all code, including the design system and application code, in a single repository. Tools like Turborepo can optimize the build process and streamline workflows.

### Pros

- Centralized Management: All code resides in one repository, making it easy to manage changes and updates across projects.
- Atomic Updates: Changes to the design system can be deployed alongside application updates, ensuring consistency and reducing fragmentation.
- Performance Optimization: Monorepo management tools can significantly improve build times and developer experience.

### Cons

- Scalability Challenges: Large monorepos can become unwieldy if not managed properly, and build times may increase with the size of the codebase.
- Coordination Needs: Effective communication among teams is essential to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth collaboration.

### Best Use Case

A monorepo is the best approach for organizations where the design system evolves frequently and requires close collaboration with application teams, facilitating faster iterations and consistent updates.

### Example

A tech company that frequently releases updates to both its design system and applications may choose a monorepo to ensure that teams can work in parallel without delays.

## 4. Package Management Approach (e.g., npm/yarn)

### Overview

Using a package management approach involves publishing the design system as a package (e.g., npm) for consumption by applications. This strategy allows for easy integration and version management.

### Pros

- Independent Releases: Applications can easily adopt the latest stable version of the design system without needing direct access to the repository.
- Version Control: Projects can specify which version of the design system to use, simplifying updates and dependency management.
- Broad Compatibility: This approach allows for easier integration with various development environments and workflows.

### Cons

- Deployment Complexity: Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for building and publishing the design system can add initial overhead.
- Dependency Management: Applications must manage version updates and compatibility, which can become complex over time.

### Best Use Case

The package management approach is ideal for organizations that want to maintain independence while allowing easy integration of the design system into projects.

### Example

A SaaS company may publish their design system as an npm package, allowing different teams to easily integrate it into their applications while maintaining a clear versioning strategy.

## Hybrid Approaches

While the strategies above are often used independently, many organizations find that a hybrid approach combining elements of different strategies can be beneficial. For example:

- Monorepo with Package Publishing: Using a monorepo for development but publishing the design system as a package for external consumption.
- Submodules with Package Management: Maintaining the design system as a submodule but also publishing it as a package for easier integration in some projects.

Hybrid approaches can offer flexibility and address specific organizational needs, but they may also introduce additional complexity. Careful planning and clear documentation are crucial when implementing a hybrid strategy.

## Maintenance and Migration Strategies

Regardless of the chosen approach, maintaining a design system over time and potentially migrating between strategies requires careful planning:

### Maintenance Best Practices

1. Regular Updates: Schedule regular updates to the design system to keep it current with evolving design trends and technology.
2. Versioning: Implement a clear versioning strategy (e.g., semantic versioning) to manage updates and communicate changes effectively.
3. Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation for both the design system itself and the management strategy in use.
4. Testing: Implement thorough testing procedures to ensure updates don't introduce breaking changes.

### Migration Strategies

When migrating from one management strategy to another:

1. Gradual Transition: Consider a phased approach, migrating one project or team at a time to minimize disruption.
2. Parallel Systems: Temporarily maintain both old and new systems during the transition period.
3. Clear Communication: Ensure all teams are aware of the migration plan, timeline, and any required actions on their part.
4. Training: Provide training and resources to help teams adapt to the new strategy.

## Team Size and Structure Considerations

The choice of design system management strategy can be significantly influenced by team size and structure:

### Small Teams / Startups

- Prefer simplicity and rapid iteration
- May benefit from Git subtree or a simple monorepo approach
- Less need for strict version control across multiple projects

### Medium-sized Organizations

- Balance between flexibility and standardization
- Package management or monorepo approaches often work well
- May start to benefit from more structured version control

### Large Enterprises

- Require scalable solutions that can handle multiple teams and projects
- May benefit from Git submodules or a well-managed monorepo
- Often need strict version control and the ability to manage multiple versions simultaneously

### Distributed Teams

- Benefit from clear documentation and well-defined processes
- Package management approaches can provide clear boundaries
- Monorepos with good tooling can facilitate collaboration across locations

### Cross-functional Teams

- Benefit from approaches that facilitate collaboration between designers and developers
- Monorepos or package management with good documentation and tooling can support cross-functional workflows

When choosing a strategy, consider not just your current team structure but also your growth plans and how the chosen approach will scale with your organization.

## Conclusion: Finding the Right Strategy

The best strategy for managing a design system maintained separately from application development teams largely depends on the frequency of changes, team structure, and collaboration needs. Consider the following factors when making your decision:

- Team size and structure
- Frequency of updates to the design system
- Need for version control and rollback capabilities
- Collaboration requirements between design and development teams
- Scalability needs
- Existing tooling and workflows

By carefully evaluating these factors and the dynamics of your projects, you can choose the strategy that best supports your design system's goals, enhances collaboration, and drives efficiency across development efforts.


Take the time to assess your current approach to managing your design system. Consider conducting team discussions or workshops to gather input on challenges and preferences, helping you make an informed decision that aligns with your organization's goals. Remember that as your organization grows and evolves, your chosen strategy may need to adapt as well.
