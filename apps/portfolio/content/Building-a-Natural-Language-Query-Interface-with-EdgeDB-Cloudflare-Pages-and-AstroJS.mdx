# Building a Natural Language Query Interface with EdgeDB, Cloudflare Pages, and AstroJS

## Introduction
Imagine you're knee-deep in a complex dataset, trying to find specific information. Traditionally, this would involve knowing the exact query language or structure, which can be, let’s be honest, a bit of a headache. Now, what if you could simply ask your database a question in plain English, and it understood you? Sounds like a dream, right? Well, that’s the magic of a natural language query interface.
In this article, we’re going to walk through how you can build this kind of interface for querying documents stored in EdgeDB using natural language. We’ll be using Cloudflare Pages, AstroJS, and some modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to make it all happen.

## Overview
Here’s what we’re going to cover:
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Component**: Turning what users say into structured queries that EdgeDB can understand.
2. **Backend API with Hono on Cloudflare Workers**: This is the middleman, taking the query and fetching the right data from EdgeDB.
3. **Frontend with AstroJS**: The user-facing part where the magic happens.
4. **Automating Document Conversion to JSON**: Making sure all your documents are in a format that EdgeDB can work with.
5. **EdgeDB Schema Considerations**: Optimizing your database so everything runs smoothly.
6. **Handling Edge Cases**: Preparing for those “What the heck does this query mean?” moments.
7. **Deployment**: Getting your application live on Cloudflare.
8. **Hosting Python for Backend Processing**: How to handle Python-based tasks alongside your Cloudflare-hosted application.

## 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Component
Let’s start with the brains of the operation—the NLP component. This is what makes it possible for users to talk to your database like they’re chatting with a friend. It’s all about interpreting what they say, turning it into something EdgeDB can understand, and dealing with any ambiguities along the way.
### a. The Role of NLP
The main job of the NLP component is pretty straightforward:
- **Understand User Intent**: It figures out what the user wants, even if they aren’t speaking in SQL or some other query language.
- **Create Structured Queries**: It takes that understanding and converts it into a structured query—specifically, EdgeQL.
- **Handle Ambiguity**: If the user’s query is a bit fuzzy, it’ll try to clarify or offer alternatives.

**Example Scenario**:
- **User Query**: "Find all documents related to product specifications created this year."
- **NLP Output**: An EdgeQL query that digs up documents tagged as product specifications with a creation date within the current year.

### b. Tools and Technologies for NLP
Now, how do we actually implement this? Here, we use Python for development and processing tasks, which is ideal for handling natural language processing tasks. However, keep in mind that Python doesn’t run directly on Cloudflare Workers. Instead, you use Python locally or on another server to prepare the necessary code and data, which then interacts with your Cloudflare-hosted application.

Some of the tools you might use include:
- **OpenAI GPT**: OpenAI’s GPT is like having a super-smart assistant who understands natural language and can turn it into something your database can work with. You send it a user query, and it sends back a structured EdgeQL query.
```python

import openai

def convert_to_edgeql(user_query):
prompt = f"Convert the following natural language query to EdgeQL: {user_query}"
response = openai.Completion.create(
engine="text-davinci-003",
prompt=prompt,
max_tokens=100
)

edgeql_query = response.choices[0].text.strip()
return edgeql_query

```

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: If you’re into hosting your own models, Hugging Face Transformers are great. They offer a ton of pre-trained models that you can fine-tune to get exactly what you need.
```python

from transformers import pipeline

def convert_to_edgeql(user_query):
nlp_model = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="your-finetuned-model")
edgeql_query = nlp_model(user_query)[0]['generated_text']
return edgeql_query
```

- **LangChain**: This is like a Swiss Army knife for NLP tasks. LangChain lets you string together multiple NLP tasks—like recognizing user intent, extracting key entities, and generating the final query.
```python

from langchain import LLMChain
from langchain.chains import TransformChain, SimpleChain

def convert_to_edgeql(user_query):
nlp_pipeline = LLMChain(
llm="text-davinci-003",
transform=TransformChain(),
output_chain=SimpleChain()
)

edgeql_query = nlp_pipeline(user_query)
return edgeql_query
	```


### c. How It All Works: From Query to EdgeQL
Here’s the step-by-step of what happens when a user asks a question:

1. **Pre-processing the Query**
- **Tokenization**: This just means breaking down what the user says into individual words or phrases to understand the structure.
- **Intent Recognition**: Figuring out what the user actually wants (like searching, filtering, or sorting).
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifying important pieces of information in the query, like dates, product names, or document types.

**Example**:
- **User Query**: "Find product specifications from March 2023."
- **Pre-processed Output**:
- **Intent**: Search
- **Entities**: `product specifications`, `March 2023`

2. **Mapping to Schema**
- The NLP model needs to understand your EdgeDB schema so it can map what the user says to the right fields.
- Then, it builds a corresponding EdgeQL query.

**Example**:
- **Mapping**: `product specifications` → `Product.specifications`
- **Constructed Query**:

```edgeql
SELECT Product {
name,
specifications
}
FILTER .created_at >= '2023-03-01' AND .created_at < '2023-04-01';
```

3. **Post-processing and Validation**
- **Query Validation**: The system makes sure the generated query is correct and works with your EdgeDB schema.
- **Error Handling**: If something’s off, it asks the user for more info or suggests alternatives.

## 2. Backend API with Hono on Cloudflare Workers
Next up is the backend API. This is like the middleman between the user’s query and your EdgeDB database. We’re using Hono, a lightweight web framework perfect for running on Cloudflare Workers.

**Components**:
- **Hono**: This framework handles HTTP requests. It’s super light and fast, making it perfect for serverless environments.
- **EdgeDB HTTP Client**: This is what you’ll use to run the EdgeQL queries generated by your NLP component.


**Workflow**:
1. **Receive NL Query**: Hono gets a POST request with the user's natural language query.
2. **Process Query**: The query is passed to the NLP service, which converts it into EdgeQL.
3. **Execute Query**: The EdgeQL query is executed against EdgeDB.
4. **Return Results**: The results are sent back to the frontend as JSON.


**Example API Flow**:

```javascript

import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { createHttpClient } from 'edgedb';
const app = new Hono();

app.post('/api/search', async (c) => {
const { query } = await c.req.json();
const edgeqlQuery = await convertToEdgeql(query); // NLP processing
const results = await executeEdgeDBQuery(edgeqlQuery); // EdgeDB query execution
return c.json(results);
});

export default app;
```

## 3. Frontend with AstroJS
Now let’s talk about the frontend—the part users actually interact with. We’re using AstroJS, which is great for building fast, responsive sites. One of the standout features here is Astro’s server islands, which allow you to efficiently manage and render dynamic components on the server side. This means less JavaScript on the client side and faster load times.

**Key Components**:

- **Search Bar**: Where users type in their queries.
- **API Integration**: This is where you’ll use `fetch` or `Axios` to send queries to the Hono API.
- **Results Display**: This is where you show the data returned from the backend.

By leveraging Astro’s server islands, you can optimize the rendering of specific components that need server-side data processing, like the search results. This ensures that only the necessary JavaScript is sent to the client, keeping your app speedy.


**Example Component**:

```tsx

import { useState } from 'react';
const SearchComponent = () => {
const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
const [results, setResults] = useState(null);
const handleSearch = async () => {
const response = await fetch('/api/search', {
method: 'POST',
headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
});

const data = await response.json();
setResults(data);
};

return (
<div>
<input
type="text"
value={query}
onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
placeholder="Ask your question..."
/>

<button onClick={handleSearch}>Search</button>
<div>
{results && <pre>{JSON.stringify(results, null, 2)}</pre>}
</div>
</div>
);
};

export default SearchComponent;
```

  This simple interface makes it easy for users to interact with your data, while Astro’s server islands keep everything fast and smooth.
  

## 4. Automating Document Conversion to JSON
Alright, let’s talk about getting your documents ready for querying. The goal here is to convert various document types (like Word, PDF, and Excel) into JSON format so they can be easily stored and retrieved in EdgeDB.

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Detecting and Uploading Documents**:
- Set up a system to monitor a directory or an upload endpoint where documents are placed.
- When a new document is detected, kick off the conversion process.

2. **Document Conversion**:
- **Word Documents (.docx)**: Use libraries like `python-docx` or `Mammoth` to extract text and convert it into JSON.
- **PDF Documents**: Tools like `PyMuPDF` (fitz) or `pdfminer.six` are great for extracting text and converting it into JSON.
- **Excel Files (.xlsx)**: Use `pandas` to convert Excel data into JSON.
- **HTML Files**: `BeautifulSoup` is your friend here, helping you parse and convert HTML into JSON.
- **Plain Text Files**: Simple scripts can convert lines of text into a JSON array.

**Note**: Remember that these conversions would be handled outside of Cloudflare Workers, typically on a separate server or locally, and then the resulting JSON would be uploaded or sent to EdgeDB.

**Example Python Code**:

```python

import pandas as pd
import json
def excel_to_json(file_path):
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)
return df.to_json(orient="records", indent=4)
def save_to_edgedb(json_data, edgedb_client):

# Assuming you have a client setup for EdgeDB

edgedb_client.query('''
INSERT Product {
name := <str>$name,
specifications := <json>$specifications
};
''', json_data)

# Example usage
json_data = excel_to_json("example.xlsx")
save_to_edgedb(json_data, edgedb_client)

```

3. **Storing JSON in EdgeDB**:
- Once converted, store the JSON data in EdgeDB under the appropriate fields.
- Use the `json` type in EdgeDB to store flexible document-like data.

4. **Scheduling and Automation**:
- Automate this whole process with cron jobs or serverless functions that trigger when a new document is uploaded.
- Make sure you have error handling in place for any failed conversions or incomplete uploads.

**Example Workflow**:
- **New Document**: A new PDF is uploaded to your system.
- **Automatic Conversion**: The document is converted to JSON using the appropriate Python library.
- **Storage**: The JSON data is automatically inserted into EdgeDB under the relevant schema.
- **Query Availability**: The data is now ready for natural language queries.

## 5. EdgeDB Schema Considerations
To get the best performance out of your natural language queries, it’s important to optimize your EdgeDB schema:
- **Indexes on JSON Fields**: These help speed up queries on document-like data stored in JSON fields.
- **Predefined Query Templates**: Having some common queries predefined can make the NLP processing simpler and faster.
- **Caching**: Take advantage of Cloudflare’s caching to store frequent query results or NLP model responses.

**Example Schema**:
```edgedb

module default {
type Product {
required property name -> str;
property specifications -> json;
}
}
```

## 6. Handling Edge Cases
Natural language is tricky, so you need to be ready for edge cases:
- **Ambiguous Queries**: Implement fallback mechanisms, like asking the user to clarify what they mean.
- **Error Handling**: Make sure your system can handle errors gracefully, whether it’s a failed query conversion or an issue with the database.

**Example**:
If the NLP service struggles to generate a valid query, return a message asking the user for more specific input or suggest possible query formats.


## 7. Deployment
Finally, let’s get this thing live!
- **AstroJS on Cloudflare Pages**: Deploy your frontend to Cloudflare Pages.
- **Hono API on Cloudflare Workers**: Deploy your backend API as a serverless function.
- **EdgeDB**: Ensure your EdgeDB instance is accessible from Cloudflare Workers using environment variables for connection details.

**Deployment Steps**:
1. **Push AstroJS Project** to Cloudflare Pages.
2. **Deploy Hono API** using the Cloudflare Workers dashboard or CLI.
3. **Connect EdgeDB**: Make sure you have a secure and efficient connection between your API and EdgeDB.


## 8. Hosting Python for Backend Processing
Since Python is often the go-to language for tasks like natural language processing or document conversion, it’s important to consider how to host Python services that complement your Cloudflare Workers setup.

**Hosting Options**:
- **AWS Lambda**: A serverless option that allows you to run Python code on-demand. It's cost-effective and integrates well with Cloudflare Workers via API Gateway.
- **Google Cloud Functions**: Similar to AWS Lambda, offering serverless execution of Python code.
- **Heroku**: A Platform-as-a-Service that supports Python, allowing you to deploy Flask or Django apps that can be called from your Cloudflare Workers.
- **DigitalOcean / AWS EC2 / Google Compute Engine**: For more control, you can run Python services on dedicated cloud servers.
- **Managed Kubernetes**: For complex setups, use managed Kubernetes services like GKE or EKS to run your Python microservices.

**Example Integration**:
If you choose AWS Lambda:
- Deploy your Python code as a Lambda function.
- Use AWS API Gateway to expose the function as an HTTP endpoint.
- Your Cloudflare Worker can then make HTTP requests to this endpoint, passing data (e.g., a document to be converted) and receiving processed data (e.g., JSON output).
This approach allows you to leverage the power of Python for tasks that Cloudflare Workers aren’t suited for, while still keeping your overall application fast and scalable.


## Conclusion
By combining AstroJS, Hono, Cloudflare Workers, and a robust NLP service, along with automating the conversion of various document types to JSON for storage in EdgeDB, you can create a powerful, user-friendly interface for querying data using natural language. The detailed NLP component, with its ability to interpret user intent and handle complex queries, is crucial for making the querying process smooth and effective. Plus, by leveraging Astro’s server islands, you ensure that your app is fast and responsive.

Additionally, integrating Python-hosted services allows you to handle more complex tasks, like NLP and document conversion, which Cloudflare Workers alone might not handle effectively. This setup can be scaled and adapted to fit all kinds of applications, whether you’re running an e-commerce platform, managing documents, or something else entirely.
